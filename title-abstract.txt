Title:
Longitudinal Integrative Graphical Medical Application

Abstract:
Major inefficiencies in healthcare systems today leave patients and clinicians alike wanting for a more effective way of receiving and giving care. Weâ€™ve identified two key deficiencies:
1. the absence of an integrated Electronic Health Record (EHR), lifelog, and personal omics data
2. the lack of standardization across healthcare systems, data standards, and terminologies.
